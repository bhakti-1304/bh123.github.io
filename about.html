        <p>Aurangabad - “The Tourism capital of Maharashtra”, is a historical city in Maharashtra. It is the administrative headquarters of Aurangabad district and is the largest city in the Marathwada region. Located on a hilly terrain in the Deccan region, Aurangabad is the fourth-most populous urban area in Maharashtra with a population of 1,175,116. Despite its embrace of modernity, Aurangabad retains its connection with past glory, heritage and traditions.</p>
        <p>Aurangabad is a popular tourism hub not only in India but also the international circuit, with tourist destinations like the spectacular Ajanta and Ellora caves lying on its outskirts, both of which have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1983. Other tourist attractions include the Daulatabad Fort, Grishneshwar Temple, Jama Mosque, Himayat Bagh, Panchakki and Salim Ali Lake. Historically, there were 52 Gates in Aurangabad, because of which Aurangabad is nicknamed as the "City of Gates".</p>
        <p>The city also has a vibrant industrial economy, with industrial clusters in Waluj and Chikalthana. In 2019, the Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC) became the first greenfield industrial smart city of India under the country's flagship Smart Cities Mission.</p>
        <p>Several prominent educational institutions, including Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, are located in the city.</p>
        <p>Aurangabad thus has a rare distinction of a city presenting a perfect confluence of historical heritage, modern industry and educational eminence.
